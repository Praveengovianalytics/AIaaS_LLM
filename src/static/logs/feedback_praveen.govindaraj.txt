User_Timestamp: 2023-09-28 03:48:11 | User_Input: give details about device fee
Bot_Timestamp: 2023-09-28 03:52:05 | Bot_Response: 
The device fee for an item such as a router, modem, or receiver can be found in the devices table under the property of deviceFees. The amount field contains the monetary value of the fee, and the conversionDate indicates when the currency was converted if necessary. For example, if the deviceFees object has the following properties:
amount = 100.00; conversionDate = "2022-03-01"; currencyCode = "USD" then the device fee for this item is $100 as of March 1, 2022, and was converted from USD to your local currency if necessary.
If you have any other questions or need further clarification on this topic please let me know.
